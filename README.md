# CodinGameSpringChallenge2022

Postmortem:
With a ranking of 2543rd out of 7705 this was a proper, but surely not spectacular approach.
While the general architecture of my approach was very flexible, I was fighting with buggy behavior which slowed down my progression.

This was mostly due to me not being super fit with this kind of programming (maths mostly), so I couldn't even deploy dynamic strategy changes as opposed to just strategy adoptions.
In hindsight I also should've decided on the next step in target centric fashion rather than a hero centric. But as I realized this, it was already too late to do such a big refactoring.

For a very first challenge of this fashion I think it was good, but very much improvable.
